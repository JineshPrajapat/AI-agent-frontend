A Hodgkin and Huxley type neuron model was used to propose that individual neurons process signals by binding synaptic inputs into a single output event based on temporal coherence, using inhibition as a control factor [0801.0250v1]. A contrastive learning framework, NeurPIR, was introduced to learn time-invariant representations of neurons from their activity data, enabling accurate neuron type and location prediction [2502.10425v2]. A simplified neuronal network model was used to demonstrate that lesions disrupting neuronal connections or killing neurons cause different types of desynchronization in the brain [1510.01732v1]. A mechanism based on threshold-type reaction, stochastic stimuli, and electrical leakage in projection neurons can enhance the selectivity of olfactory bulb projection neurons [1904.08767v1].\n",

                "abstract": "Several experimental studies show the existence of leader neurons in\npopulation bursts of 2D living neural networks. A leader neuron is, basically,\na neuron which fires at the beginning of a burst (respectively network spike)\nmore often that we expect by looking at its whole mean neural activity. This\nmeans that leader neurons have some burst triggering power beyond a simple\nstatistical effect. In this study, we characterize these leader neuron\nproperties. This naturally leads us to simulate neural 2D networks. To build\nour simulations, we choose the leaky integrate and fire (lIF) neuron model. Our\nlIF model has got stable leader neurons in the burst population that we\nsimulate. These leader neurons are excitatory neurons and have a low membrane\npotential firing threshold. Except for these two first properties, the\nconditions required for a neuron to be a leader neuron are difficult to\nidentify and seem to depend on several parameters involved in the simulations\nthemself. However, a detailed linear analysis shows a trend of the properties\nrequired for a neuron to be a leader neuron. Our main finding is: A leader\nneuron sends a signal to many excitatory neurons as well as to a few inhibitory\nneurons and a leader neuron receives only a few signals from other excitatory\nneurons. Our linear analysis exhibits five essential properties for leader\nneurons with relative importance. This means that considering a given neural\nnetwork with a fixed mean number of connections per neuron, our analysis gives\nus a way of predicting which neuron can be a good leader neuron and which\ncannot. Our prediction formula gives us a good statistical prediction even if,\nconsidering a single given neuron, the success rate does not reach hundred\npercent.",

We assume there's a\ntime-invariant representation for the same neuron, reflecting its intrinsic\nproperties like molecular profiles, location, and morphology. The goal of\nobtaining these intrinsic neuronal representations has two criteria: (I)\nsegments from the same neuron should have more similar representations than\nthose from different neurons; (II) the representations must generalize well to\nout-of-domain data. To meet these, we propose the NeurPIR (Neuron Platonic\nIntrinsic Representation) framework. It uses contrastive learning, with\nsegments from the same neuron as positive pairs and those from different\nneurons as negative pairs. In implementation, we use VICReg, which focuses on\npositive pairs and separates dissimilar samples via regularization. We tested\nour method on Izhikevich model-simulated neuronal population dynamics data. The\nresults accurately identified neuron types based on preset hyperparameters. We\nalso applied it to two real-world neuron dynamics datasets with neuron type\nannotations from spatial transcriptomics and neuron locations. Our model's\nlearned representations accurately predicted neuron types and locations and\nwere robust on out-of-domain data (from unseen animals).
